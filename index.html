    <li>Something</li>
    <li>Another thing</li>
    <li>Also this one</li>

/3. HTML Links, Heading & Images/
<br/>********************************************************************************************************************
<h3>Links and anchors "a"</h3>
<p>Links can go anywhere: to pages on your site, to pages on other sites, or to files (like a PDF).</p>

<a href="http://www.google.com">Go to Google</a>
<p>Go to Google</p>
<p>Anchors are useful for navigating within a single web page. You need to code an anchor and a link pointing to the
    anchor to make this work. The anchor is placed where you want the user to start reading. The link is placed where
    you wish the user to click to skip to that anchor. "Back to top" links are a typical example.
</p>
<p>Anchor: <a id="top"></a></p>

<p>Link to an anchor: <a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<br/>********************************************************************************************************************
<script src="js/script.js"></script>

<br/>********************************************************************************************************************
<h3>Image "img"</h3>
<p>Displays an image on your page. Image formats include JPG, GIF, PNG. You may see SVG elements as well. The src
    (source) attribute is required. Also consider adding an alt attribute.

    JPG, GIF, PNG = raster images (a bunch of pixels)

    SVG = vector image (a mathematical equation)

    src = image source (a file path to the image)

    alt = alternative text. Displays if the image does not. Read by search engines and screen readers. It should fully
    describe the image, so you could imagine what the image looked like if you could not see it..</p>

<img src="http://placekitten.com/g/200/300" alt="A puppy." title="Bello" class="image1">
<img src="imgs/react.png" alt="react" title="react" class="image"><br/>

<h3>Quotation block "blockquote" & Citation element "cite"</h3>
<p>"blockquote" - Used for longer quotations.</p>
<p>"cite" - Used for citing a creative work.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p> Video conferencing bears a terrifying promise: Distance will no longer be an excuse for not attending
        meetings.</p>
    <cite>Steve Steinberg, 1994</cite>
</blockquote>

<br/>********************************************************************************************************************
<h3>Strong importance "strong"</h3>
<p>An item is strongly important relative to surrounding text. Text is generally rendered bold, but this is not a reason to use this tag.
</p>
<p>Putting your hand on a hot stove <strong>will get you burned</strong>. Don't do it!</p>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/strong">MDN - strong </a>

<h3>Emphasized text "em"</h3>
<p>An item is emphasized relative to surrounding text. Text is generally rendered in italics, but this is not a reason to use this tag.</p>

<p>You simply <em>must</em> try this new coffee shop!</p>
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em">MDN - em </a>
<br/>********************************************************************************************************************
<h3>    What is the difference between strong and em ? </h3>
<p>
    While em is used to change the meaning of a sentence as spoken emphasis does ("I love carrots" vs. "I love carrots"), strong is used to give portions of a sentence added importance (e.g., "Warning! This is very dangerous.") Both strong and em can be nested to increase the relative degree of importance or stress emphasis, respectively.
</p>

<h3>Validating HTML</h3>

<a href="http://validator.w3.org/">http://validator.w3.org/</a>

<br/>********************************************************************************************************************

<h3>Mark up a book chapter</h3>
<p>Go to this page: https://github.com/FrontendMasters/bootcamp/blob/master/static/exercises/1-html/book%20excerpt.txt</p>

<p>Copy out the text that is posted there. This is the first chapter of a book published in 1922 and which is now out of copyright.</p>

<p>Reformat this document in HTML, marking up anything you think relevant, based on the tags you learned. Note that in some places, I've called for emphasis, while there's a link in another place.</p>

<br/>********************************************************************************************************************

<h2>Additional HTML practice</h2>

<p>If you finish early, and/or you want some more practice, work through the following sections of exercises at W3Schools:</p>

<p>https://www.w3schools.com/html/exercise.asp</p>

<ul>
    <li>HTML Attributes exercises 2-5</li>
    <li>HTML Headings, all exercises</li>
    <li>HTML Paragraphs, exercises 1-3</li>
    <li>HTML Comments, all exercises</li>
    <li>HTML Links, exercises 1-3, 5</li>
    <li>HTML Images, exercises 1, 3, 5, 6</li>
    <li>HTML Lists, exercises 1-2</li>
</ul>

<h3>On Your Own</h3>
<p>Once you've finished the above work, start creating an "about" page that's all about you. In this page, include the following:</p>

A paragraph of information about who you are, where you live, and what you currently do for work

Another paragraph describing what you'd like to do in web design and development

Make a list of three important things to know about you

Include a favorite quote, with citation for the person who said it

Include at least one picture of yourself

Link to a website that you like to visit frequently

If you still need more to do, make a page about some of your hobbies and activities. Include:

What is this hobby exactly?

How does it make you feel?

Where have you traveled because of your hobby? What other life experiences has your hobby provided, that you might not otherwise experience?

Photos and/or videos of your hobby in action

Links to websites describing your hobby, or where hobbyists discuss what they do

If you manage to get as far as creating both web pages, link them together with a navigation bar.

As always, do not be concerned with how these pages look. They are Ugly Web Pages™! Be sure to use the right HTML tags to communicate what the content is about, not what you think is pretty.
